## Inspiration
I often describe the game Rimworld, as a game you play to tell stories about it later to your friends. I find this to be true with most of the video games I enjoy. There isn't a set story besides the one you make along the way. I've long toyed with the idea of writing down short stories inspired by my Rimworld play throughs but never found the time or motivation. With the popularity of Chat-GPT and having found some use for it in my day job... I thought this sounds like the perfect use case. My idea for this series is to use AI tools to transform my bullet point notes into an actual intelligent story. It may or may not work; but I will attempt it anyway







### Raw Notes
- We begin with Robert a colonist embarking on his journey to settle a new colony on a rimworld far out in the galaxy
-  Robert is an escaped slave from a postage delivery vessel
- He is very sensitive to the sunlight and prefers darkness; preferably inside a mountain 
- He crashes out of the postage ship into an unforgiving desert on an un-named rimworld
- He kidnaps' his masters dog to spite him and immediately slaughters it when landing
- He lands with some medicine and food taken from the ship
- He starts digging his home into the surrounding stone
-  His second day on the planet he was attacked by a rabid fox, he tried to kill it but his aim was bad so it took some of his food and ran off
- He constructed a makeshift table to butcher meat on





### Prompt
I'm going to give you a bullet point point list detailing my exploits in the game Rimworld. I'd like you to transform that list into a cohesive story that I can share with others. It should be well written, funny and capture the essence of the video game Rimworld. You should utilize the lore and backstory of rimworld to piece in missing details and keep the plot consistent.
