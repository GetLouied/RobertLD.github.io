A collection of memorable epigrams I've heard

## Inspiration
I found this post from [Yale](https://cpsc.yale.edu/epigrams-programming) recently, that lists Computer Science related epigrams from ACMâ€™s SIGPLAN publication of the same name,. After reading through some of them, I thought it would be interesting to compile a list of of similar short phrases that I found amusing. Some of these are copied from the above, others from mentors and peers.


## Epigrams in Programming

1. Once code has reached production, it's lifetime exceeds your own.
2. Don't pose an idea, unless willing to implement it.
3. Quality Assurance's only job should be to watch Youtube on the clock.
4. "That should be trivial" is a cursed statement.
