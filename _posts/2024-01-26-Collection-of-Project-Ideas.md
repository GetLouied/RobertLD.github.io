I often find myself short on project ideas to explore in my free time. I'm making an effort here to keep track of project ideas I've had or found and are interested in pursuing.

## Project Ideas

### Large Theory Heavy Projects
1. Anything from the [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) list
	1. Build your own Database
	2. Create a programming language
	3. Customized text editor with LSP support
	4. 

### Consumer Applications
1. Build a mobile app that reminds users if they've taken their pills today or not

### Small and Useful 
#### CLI Applications
1. CLI application called `td` that takes the input and makes a todo item in the daily obsidian note with the timestamp of when it was made
#### Web
1.  Website that is a decision matrix for which programming language to learn next based on user provided information. Tech: Golang/ HTMX
#### Personal GUI Tools
1. PQL and SQL wrapper around parquet files with a GUI interface similar to datagrip.

### Functional Prorgramming
1. Using elixir/F# to build a simple website with as little dependency on JavaScript as possible

### Machine Learning
1. LLM trained specifically on the AST representation of a specific programming language.



5. 
6. 
7. OpenAPI client generator. Parse a swagger document and generate a client for interacting with that specific API.
8. Personal Finance simulator and decision maker
9. Parquet/CSV file combiner and splitter cli tool
10. Remote SQL driver server. Spin up the simple web-server and let it handle the querying and sending the results back. For databases without HTTP support
11. Evolution simulation game with simple plants and animals (Golang?)
12. Anomaly Detection ML model build on top of Loki logs
13. Market Trading Simulator using Agents with simple Neural Networks existing as Coroutines. They interact real-time with a global market data-structure
14. Garbage Collector for a non-garbage collected language
15. Tenet management system for landlords
16. Workflow engine that supports job dependencies, retries and priority
17. Bitbucket plugin in clojure to add git-semver to PullRequests
18. VSCode plugin to add Automatic SQL formatting for strings
19. Agents that use emails to interact with the world (game over SMTP)
20. Training a model on a dental X-ray that can detect what type of implant someone has in
