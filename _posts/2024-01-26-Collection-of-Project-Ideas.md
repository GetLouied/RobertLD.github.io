I often find myself short on project ideas to explore in my free time. I'm making an effort here to keep track of project ideas I've had or found and are interested in pursuing.

# Project Ideas

A collection of all the project ideas I've thought would be interesting to implement. I've tried to organize them as best as possible below.

## Potentially Marketable Projects
Out of all the ideas, I think these projects have the most potential to make it to market and become successful products or services.


## Personal Projects
These are projects that are useful to me personally or offer some simple functionality that I desire on a day to day basis.


## Exercises in Learning 
Projects designed to expand personal knowledge on a topic or a series of topics.






### Large Theory Heavy Projects
1. Anything from the [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) list
	1. Build your own Database
	2. Create a programming language
	3. Customized text editor with LSP support
2. NoSQL database designed specifically around one type of data. Could be vectors, could be strings, could be... something else?

### Consumer Applications (App)
1. Build a mobile app that reminds users if they've taken their pills today or not
2. Remote SQL driver server. Spin up the simple web-server and let it handle the querying and sending the results back. For databases without HTTP support

### Small and Useful 
#### CLI Applications
1. CLI application called `td` that takes the input and makes a todo item in the daily obsidian note with the timestamp of when it was made
2. OpenAPI client generator. Parse a swagger document and generate a client for interacting with that specific API.
3.  Parquet/CSV file combiner and splitter cli tool
#### Web
1.  Website that is a decision matrix for which programming language to learn next based on user provided information. Tech: Golang/ HTMX
#### Personal GUI Tools
1. PQL and SQL wrapper around parquet files with a GUI interface similar to datagrip.
2. Personal Finance simulator and decision maker



### Exercises in Learning

#### Simulations
1. Evolution simulation game with simple plants and animals (Golang?)
2. Market Trading Simulator using Agents with simple Neural Networks existing as Coroutines. They interact real-time with a global market data-structure


### Functional Programming
1. Using elixir/F# to build a simple website with as little dependency on JavaScript as possible

### Machine Learning
1. LLM trained specifically on the AST representation of a specific programming language.
2. Anomaly Detection ML model build on top of Loki logs
3.

15. Bitbucket plugin in clojure to add git-semver to PullRequests
16. VSCode plugin to add Automatic SQL formatting for strings
17. Agents that use emails to interact with the world (game over SMTP)
18. Training a model on a dental X-ray that can detect what type of implant someone has in
